  <summary>compiling it yourself</summary
    <h3>First of all im assuming you already know how to compile UPSILON/OMEGA if not see <a href="https://github.com/Lauryy06/Upsilon">this</a>, alright we can start </h3> 

  1. replace the epsilon_light folder located at \Upsilon\themes\themes\local with the new theme.
  
  2. replace the epsilon_light.json file located at \Upsilon\themes\themes\local with the new .json 
  
  3. you can now compile it with ``make OMEGA_USERNAME="your-name" THEME-NAME="epsilon_light -j4`` and if you wish to have bin files, add ``binpack`` before the ``-j4``
  
  <h2>4. you're done, you can now follow the How to install bins section if needed! </h2>
